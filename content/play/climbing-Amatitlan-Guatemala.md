Video from a rock climbing trip to Amatitl&aacute;n, Guatemala...

Edited down from lots of boring footage to 3 minutes with [LightWorks](https://www.lwks.com/) fantastic free professional level video editor. <s>Music is ['Platoon'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JkDzNOgO3U) by Jungle.</s> Music is boring generic music because of YouTube's DCMA takedowns.
