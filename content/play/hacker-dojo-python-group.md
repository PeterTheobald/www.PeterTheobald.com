# Hacker Dojo Python Group
## About
[Hacker Dojo](https://hackerdojo.org/) is a collaborative hackerspace in Silicon Valley where tech enthusiasts gather to build, experiment and improve. The Hacker Dojo Python Group is a group of people interested in learning more about developing in the Python programming language.

<!--more-->

We meet every Tuesday night at 6:30 at the [Hacker Dojo](https://hackerdojo.org/) in Mountain View, CA. Our discussions usually start with a specific topic such as a programming technique, Python language features, or a new module or library. Some nights are good for beginners just learning Python and some get pretty advanced. We usually follow the threads of our conversation off into whatever questions or tangents interest the group that night. The discussions are usually hosted by me, Peter Theobald or by one of our regular members.

Between meetings, come chat about your Python questions in the Python channel in the [Hacker Dojo Discord.](https://discord.gg/qz3v4ggQdP) We announce our meetings on the [Hacker Dojo Meetup page.](https://www.meetup.com/hackerdojo/events/)

The meetings are oriented around in-person conversations gathered together at the [Hacker Dojo](https://hackerdojo.org/), but we do usually stream the meetings in the [Hacker Dojo Discord](https://discord.gg/qz3v4ggQdP) 'Dojo Voicebox' channel, although remote is not ideal because it can be hard to catch everyone's comments and it is harder to ask questions.
