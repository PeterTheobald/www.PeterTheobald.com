title: "About me..."
---
I am a **software engineer** and **computer forensics analyst** (and also a husband, geeky dad and rock climber). This is my personal site with posts about [programming](/categories/tech/), [geeky fun stuff, making things and rock climbing](/categories/personal/). I also have [posts on my company website](http://www.tcforensics.com) that talks about forensics cases for a less technical audience.

I am the owner of [TC Forensics](http://www.tcforensics.com) where I provide computer forensics services such as finding hidden or destroyed data, investigating cryptocurrency transactions, investigating medical provider data breaches, and providing litigation support and expert testimony related to computer evidence.

Less frequently I develop web sites and internet-connected desktop applications.

For more details view my full [resume](/downloads/Peter Theobald resume.pdf). Some highlights are:

* I Founded [LI Net](https://angel.co/company/li-net), an early Internet Service Provider, with three partners and little capital; In four years we built LI Net into the largest ISP on Long Island and one of the largest in New York. Just as we were looking at an angel round of funding to expand we accepted an acquisition offer from [Verio](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/verio#/entity), a national roll-up of the leading regional ISPs, for over $7M cash plus Verio stock.
* At [Lehman Brothers](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/lehman-brothers#/entity), I provided support and customizations in C++ and Bash for the Fixed-Income Derivatives department, mostly for the overnight portfolio risk management processes. A highlight was adding support for path-dependent Bermuda style options to our SUMMIT based Black-Scholes option pricing models.
* I developed the full stack for several web sites, including SponsorClick.com, AgencyAccess.com, DMLT (Investment Cafe) Reporting, Wine Alert (eRobertParker.com) web scraping system, ICS Network Systems (MailSentry) where my anti-spam work (in Python) was granted a U.S. patent, AllBooks4Less.com (Half.com) and more. My weapons of choice depending on the project were: C++, Python, Perl, SQL, Javascript, Cold Fusion (Java framework similar to JSP), PHP.
* At ERI, I developed a document imaging system in C++/XWindows/Informix DB; Did installation and training for the document imaging system for Banco Bradesco in SÃ£o Paolo, Brasil and for Brooklyn Union Gas in Brooklyn, New York; Also at ERI I assisted the sales department in designing specs for custom solutions as a pre-sales engineer.
