I am a **site reliability engineer (SRE)** and **software engineer (SWE)** (and also a rock climber and geeky dad). This is my personal site with posts about [programming](/tech/), and [making geeky things and rock climbing](/play/).

I am a Senior Site Reliability Engineer for the Compute Technology Group at [Akamai](https://www.akamai.com) where I am improving reliability, metrics, observability and tooling for Linode cloud services to enable our projected 50x scaling of our cloud services network.

Previously I was a Production Engineer at [Meta (Facebook)](https://www.facebook.com) solving systems problems in reliability, scalability, performance, and security for one of the worldâ€™s largest distributed computer networks serving billions of people across Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, Oculus and other products.

Prior to that I was the founder of [TC Forensics](http://www.tcforensics.com) where I provided computer forensics services such as finding hidden or destroyed data, investigating cryptocurrency transactions, investigating medical provider data breaches, and providing litigation support and expert testimony related to computer evidence.

And before that I was a full-stack developer making web sites and internet-connected desktop applications.

For more details view my full [resume](</downloads/Peter Theobald Resume SWE 2023-05-01.pdf>). Some highlights are: 

* I Founded [LI Net](https://angel.co/company/li-net), an early Internet Service Provider, with three partners and little capital; In four years we built LI Net into the largest ISP on Long Island and one of the largest in New York. Just as we were looking at a round of funding to expand we accepted an acquisition offer from [Verio](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/verio#/entity), a national roll-up of the leading regional ISPs, for over $7M cash plus Verio stock.
* At [Lehman Brothers](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/lehman-brothers#/entity), I provided support and customizations in C++ and Bash for the Fixed-Income Derivatives department, mostly for the overnight portfolio risk management processes. A highlight was adding support for path-dependent Bermuda style options to our SUMMIT based Black-Scholes option pricing models.
* I developed the full stack for several web sites, including SponsorClick.com, AgencyAccess.com, DMLT (Investment Cafe) Reporting, Wine Alert (eRobertParker.com) web scraping system, ICS Network Systems (MailSentry) where my anti-spam work (in Python) was granted a U.S. patent, AllBooks4Less.com (Half.com) and more. My weapons of choice depending on the project were: C++, Python, Perl, SQL, Javascript, Cold Fusion (Java framework similar to JSP), PHP.
