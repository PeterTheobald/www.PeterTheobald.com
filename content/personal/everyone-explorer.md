I wrote this [Javascript page](/fun/everyone-explorer-live/) that helps me explore my entire network of people, everyone I've ever known, with a visual graph of bubbles.

Someone I hadn't thought of in years popped into my head: A couple I met scuba-diving in Fiji. That got me thinking about all the great people I've met that I haven't thought of in a long time: The concert pianist I met on a camping trip, the camp counsellor that taught me the Forth programming language. I got curious and put together [this page](/fun/everyone-explorer-live/) to help me explore all of those people. Jog your memory by adding family, events, schools, jobs and all the people you've met, expanding the circle as you dig deeper into your memories.

[Here](/fun/everyone-explorer-live/) you can try it out  
and [Here](/js/everyone.js) is the Javascript and PaperJS code behind it
