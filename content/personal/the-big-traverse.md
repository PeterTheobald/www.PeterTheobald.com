I've issued a challenge to all the great people at [Island Rock Climbing Gym](http://www.islandrock.net). Can you do The Big Traverse? It will take some practice. Once you get it, it should take between 30-45 minutes to complete. Note that there is a secret Ultimate-Traverse that involves leaping from the stair-wall across to the bouldering alcove but we won't talk about that...
