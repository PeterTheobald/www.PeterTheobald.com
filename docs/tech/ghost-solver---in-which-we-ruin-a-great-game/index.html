<main>
<p>My son showed me a new word game, &lsquo;Ghost&rsquo;, and I wrote a Python program to &ldquo;solve&rdquo; the game and find all winning sequences.</p>

<p></p>

<p>The game played like this: We took turns adding a letter to a growing word fragment, trying not to be the one to complete a valid word. Each fragment must be the beginning of an actual word and there is a minimum of 4 letters to count as a complete word. The player who completes a word loses the round.</p>

<p>For example one of our rounds went like this:</p>

<pre><code>- He started with 'T',
- I responded with 'R', 
- No matter what he responds with I will respond with 'C': TRAC, TREC, TRIC, TROC, TRUC,
- He will have to respond with K, completing a word and losing.
</code></pre>

<p>We played for a while and I really enjoyed it. So naturally I felt compelled to write a program to &ldquo;solve&rdquo; the game and find which words would guarantee a win for the player whether he plays first or second. Why would I do this when I know it will ruin the game? Didn&rsquo;t I remember how hollow the victory was when I figured out the winning sequences to Tic-Tac-Toe as a kid? Because writing this program is more fun than playing the game, that&rsquo;s why.</p>

<h1 id="the-program">The Program</h1>

<p>The algorithm is relatively simple:</p>

<ol>
<li>Read a dictionary into a tree so from any letter I can traverse what letters could follow.</li>
<li>Traverse that tree, finding words that WIN for the player and LOSE for the opponent.</li>
<li>List the words guaranteed to win for each starting letter, or choose the best of several branches when there is more than one choice.
<br /></li>
</ol>

<p>The data structure is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trie">TRIE</a> : It is a hash/dictionary with the first letters for keys and another hash/dictionary for the values. Each sub-hash/dictionary likewise has the subsequent letter as a key and another hash/dictionary as the value, until the end of a word is reached and the value will be an empty list or Null/Nil/None.</p>

<p>The search does two things:</p>

<ol>
<li>For end-of-words with no &lsquo;next letter&rsquo; return WIN if the opponent had to complete a word or LOSE if the player had to complete a word, depending on which player went first and whether it&rsquo;s an even or odd turn.</li>
<li>For all other letters (nodes) recursively check each branch. If it&rsquo;s the players turn and any branches guarantee a win choose the &lsquo;best&rsquo; branch and return it. If it&rsquo;s the opponents turn and every branch forces a win return them all. If any branches lose assume the opponent would choose that and return LOSE.</li>
</ol>

<p>Here is the code in Python. I&rsquo;ve put it up on GitHub at <a href="https://github.com/PeterTheobald/GhostSolver">ghostSolver</a></p>

# Ghost is a word game in which players take turns adding letters to a growing
# word fragment, trying not to be the one to complete a valid word. Each
# fragment must be the beginning of an actual word, there is a minimum of four
# letters of a word that counts. The player who completes a word loses the round.
#
# This program reads a dictionary and figures out words that will guarantee
# a win both for the player who plays first and the player who plays second.
#
# Input: ghostSolver.py &lt; wordlist.txt
# Output: Player goes first: list of winning words.
#         Player goes second: list of winning words.

<p>I also tried it with a 176,000 word scrabble dictionary (TWL06) a monster 267,000 word meta-dictionary compilation from several dictionaries (SOWPODS) and a smaller 32,000 word dictionary (6of12). The results from each obviously varied due to the different words available. You should use the one that most closely matches your vocabulary and the dictionary you will use to check challenges when you play. You can download a copy of these wordlists from the <a href="https://github.com/PeterTheobald/GhostSolver">GhostSolver github repo</a>.</p>

<h1 id="randall-munroe-did-it-first">Randall Munroe Did It First</h1>

<p>After going through all of this someone pointed out to me that Randall Munroe of XKCD has a <a href="https://blog.xkcd.com/2007/12/31/ghost/">blog post</a> about solving this game. He discussed it but didn&rsquo;t post any code. His results differed slightly from mine. This is due to two factors: We most likely used different dictionaries and we coded different subjective definitions of the &ldquo;best&rdquo; choice among winning branches.</p>

<p>In the code when the player has the choice of different letters that lead down different branches that each lead to winning words, I choose the &ldquo;best&rdquo; branch to present. I have subjectively coded the definition of best as:</p>

<ol>
<li>Choose the branch with fewer words in it. Remembering one winning word is better than remembering two or three winning words.</li>
<li>Otherwise choose the branch with the shortest word in it.</li>
<li>Otherwise choose the branch with a word that comes first alphabetically.
<br /></li>
</ol>

<p>This implies that a branch with one long word is considered better than a branch with two short words, and a six-word branch with 3 short words and 3 long words is considered better than a six-word branch with 6 medium length words.</p>

<p>So now I&rsquo;m satisfied. I&rsquo;ve written my program. I&rsquo;ve solved the game. I&rsquo;ve ruined Ghost.</p>

<ul>
<li>I think the algorithm is very recursive and LISPy, and would be expressed very naturally in Clojure. I&rsquo;d like to re-write it in Clojure.  UPDATE: I&rsquo;ve rewritten it in Clojure, <a href="/tech/ghost-in-clojure">read about it</a>.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;d also like to ruin my favorite game WordBase by writing an AI player. I already have the general algorithm in mind using minimax searching with alpha-beta pruning and a good static board evaluator.</li>
</ul>
