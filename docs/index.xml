      <description>I got a call from a potential client who had tried to collect his Bitcoin Diamond forked coins, but instead got scammed out of $300,000 worth of Bitcoins. He had gone to electrumdiamond.org ( DON&amp;rsquo;T GO THERE ) and downloaded fake wallet software from GitHub. He entered his wallet recovery seed into the software ( NEVER DO THIS ) and the software used his recovery seed to steal all his Bitcoins.</description>

      <title>Traversing for Endurance</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I do most of my climbing in an indoor gym, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.islandrock.net&#34;&gt;Island Rock&lt;/a&gt;. I find that climbing in the gym trains me for short powerful climbs, but outside I was getting pumped after the 30-40 vertical feet I was used to. A great training routine for endurance is to do long traverses, so I laid out a traverse route that hits every wall in the gym. The difficulty varies over time as the gym resets each wall; Some sections felt around V.2, some around V.5. At first I found it difficult to finish the entire traverse. When I finally was able to complete one full traverse it took me 40 minutes to complete it. I was forced to learn techniques to rest on the wall, hanging on straight arms, finding ways to place my feet with opposing force to rest. Eventually, with practice in resting and in finding the best sequence of holds I got it down to 16 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I made up a poster explaining The Big Traverse and hung it up. Within days I was seeing people working their way across the traverse. I&amp;rsquo;ve included a link to the full poster below as an example so you can make something similar for your local gym.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Many security cameras export video in a proprietary format called DAV which is difficult to work with. I wrote this program to convert DAV videos into standard MP4 video.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Dave doesn&amp;rsquo;t think any of my jokes are funny. I keep trying but he always says the same thing, &amp;ldquo;That&amp;rsquo;s not funny&amp;rdquo;. So like all repetitive processes, I automated it. This page scrapes jokes from &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes&#34;&gt;Reddit/r/Jokes&lt;/a&gt; and presents them here as texts to Dave.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Ghost Solver - Now in Clojure</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;/tech/ghost-game-solver/&#34;&gt;My previous post&lt;/a&gt; was about a Python program to calculate the moves to guarantee a win in the puzzle word game &amp;lsquo;Ghost&amp;rsquo;. The algorithm was naturally recursive and felt &amp;lsquo;LISPy&amp;rsquo;. &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.twitter.com/pdlug&#34;&gt;@pdlug&lt;/a&gt; has been telling me how writing in Clojure will expand my mind, make me more productive and hem my pants so this week I learned just enough Clojure (I already knew LISP) to re-write the Ghost game solver in Clojure.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;My son showed me a new word game, &amp;lsquo;Ghost&amp;rsquo;, and I wrote a Python program to &amp;ldquo;solve&amp;rdquo; the game and find all winning sequences.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Upgrade your Inspiron 8600 to Windows 7 with this NVidia FX Go5200 video driver</title>

      <guid>/tech/upgrade-inspiron-8600-to-windows7-with-nvidia-driver/</guid>
      <description>I have an old Dell Inspiron 8600 I wanted to upgrade to Windows 7. The problem was that there is no current video driver for the Inspiron&amp;rsquo;s Nvidia Geforce FX Go5200 video chip. Even the driver Dell is offering for download for Windows XP is the wrong one and causes all sorts of problems. There simply is no driver for Windows 7.
So I searched on NVIDIA to see what drivers might be close.</description>

      <description>With today&amp;rsquo;s announcement of Oracle Solaris Express 11 our choices for running a ZFS capable Operating System just got even more confusing. I wasn&amp;rsquo;t able to find a list of the build numbers these Operating Systems are based on all in one place, so I&amp;rsquo;m going to keep a chart of the choices here, and if readers will contribute in the comments I will keep the chart updated. The build number gives you a good idea of how recent the ZFS feature set is.</description>
