      <title>The Big Traverse</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve issued a challenge to all the great people at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.islandrock.net&#34;&gt;Island Rock Climbing Gym&lt;/a&gt;. Can you do The Big Traverse? It will take some practice. Once you get it, it should take between 30-45 minutes to complete. Note that there is a secret Ultimate-Traverse that involves leaping from the stair-wall across to the bouldering alcove but we won&amp;rsquo;t talk about that&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Many security cameras export video in a proprietary format called DAV which is difficult to work with. I wrote this program to convert DAV videos into standard MP4 video.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Dave doesn&amp;rsquo;t think any of my jokes are funny. I keep trying but he always says the same thing, &amp;ldquo;That&amp;rsquo;s not funny&amp;rdquo;. So like all repetitive processes, I automated it. This page scrapes jokes from &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes&#34;&gt;Reddit/r/Jokes&lt;/a&gt; and presents them here as texts to Dave.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;To try out the free video editor &amp;lsquo;HitFilm&amp;rsquo; I made this montage of the fake show &amp;lsquo;Troy and Abed in the Morning&amp;rsquo; from the show Community.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Ghost Solver - Now in Clojure</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;/tech/ghost-game-solver/&#34;&gt;My previous post&lt;/a&gt; was about a Python program to calculate the moves to guarantee a win in the puzzle word game &amp;lsquo;Ghost&amp;rsquo;. The algorithm was naturally recursive and felt &amp;lsquo;LISPy&amp;rsquo;. &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.twitter.com/pdlug&#34;&gt;@pdlug&lt;/a&gt; has been telling me how writing in Clojure will expand my mind, make me more productive and hem my pants so this week I learned just enough Clojure (I already knew LISP) to re-write the Ghost game solver in Clojure.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;My son showed me a new word game, &amp;lsquo;Ghost&amp;rsquo;, and I wrote a Python program to &amp;ldquo;solve&amp;rdquo; the game and find all winning sequences.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I was presented with a hard drive encrypted with TrueCrypt. TrueCrypt is unbreakable. Was there anything I could do? &lt;em&gt;(tl;dr: yes)&lt;/em&gt;

      <title>Upgrade your Inspiron 8600 to Windows 7 with this NVidia FX Go5200 video driver</title>

      <guid>/tech/upgrade-your-inspiron-8600-to-windows-7-with-this-nvidia-fx-go5200-video-driver/</guid>
      <description>I have an old Dell Inspiron 8600 I wanted to upgrade to Windows 7. The problem was that there is no current video driver for the Inspiron&amp;rsquo;s Nvidia Geforce FX Go5200 video chip. Even the driver Dell is offering for download for Windows XP is the wrong one and causes all sorts of problems. There simply is no driver for Windows 7.
So I searched on NVIDIA to see what drivers might be close.</description>

      <title>ZFS capable operating systems</title>

      <description>With today&amp;rsquo;s announcement of Oracle Solaris Express 11 our choices for running a ZFS capable Operating System just got even more confusing. I wasn&amp;rsquo;t able to find a list of the build numbers these Operating Systems are based on all in one place, so I&amp;rsquo;m going to keep a chart of the choices here, and if readers will contribute in the comments I will keep the chart updated. The build number gives you a good idea of how recent the ZFS feature set is.</description>
