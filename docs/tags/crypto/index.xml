      <description>I got a call from a potential client who had tried to collect his Bitcoin Diamond forked coins, but instead got scammed out of $300,000 worth of Bitcoins.

He entered his wallet recovery seed into the software ( NEVER DO THIS ) and the software used his recovery seed to steal all his Bitcoins.</description>
