Beautiful algorithms that will make you smarter for understanding them:

- Dijkstra's Algorithm: finding the shortest paths between nodes in a weighted graph
- A* search algorithm: shortest paths, with heuristic to make it better than Dijkstra's
- Fibonacci heap: priority queue, better than Binary heap and Binomial heap
- MinMax algorithm: find best move in zero-sum games like Chess
- Alpha-Beta heuristic: improvement to MinMax
- Monte-Carlo Tree Search MCTS: random sampling for deterministic problems which are difficult or impossible to solve using other approaches, improvement over Alpha-Beta
- Bloom Filter: test whether an element is a member of a set for extremely large sets
- Consistent Hashing: distributed hashing scheme that handles hash table resizing well
- GeoHash/QuadTree: spatial data location coding systems with arbitrary precision using space filling curves
- Leaky Bucket/Token Bucket: bursty traffic scheduling and buffering algorithms
- Trie: prefix search tree used for locating specific keys from within a set
- Raft: consensus algorithms for distributed data consistency
- Boyer-Moore: highly efficient string-searching algorithm
- Algorithm X: recursive, nondeterministic, depth-first, backtracking algorithm for solving exact cover problems (like Sudoku)
- Rsync: efficiently transferring and synchronizing files
- Merkle Tree/Hash Tree: efficient and secure verification of the contents of a large data structure, (used in blockchain cryptocurrency, and in ZFS and BTRF filesystems)
- HyperLogLog: Â count-distinct approximating the number of distinct elements in a large multiset
- Count-Min Sketch: probabilistic data structure that serves as a frequency table of events in a stream of data
- Hierarchical Timing Wheels: Efficient Implementation of a Timer Facility
- Operational Transform (OT): collaboration functionalities in advanced collaborative software (used by Google Docs for simultaneous editing)
- Conflict-free Replicated Data Types (CRDTs): newer maybe better algorithm than OT for collaborative software
- Distributed Hash Tables (DHT) -  distributed system that provides a key-value lookup service similar to a hash table. Used in P2P file sync systems like BitTorrent
- Structural Sharing of Persistent Data Structures - highly efficient immutable data structures (used by Clojure and ZFS)
